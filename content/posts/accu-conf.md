Quick post here, just to say I will be talking at ACCU Conf in the [Bristol Marriott Hotel](https://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/brsdt-bristol-marriott-hotel-city-centre/) on **Friday 13th April**. [Here](https://conference.accu.org/2018/sessions.html#XTalesofCthe6502andtheBBCwithaddedpython) is a link to my talk synopsis, if some of you remember I did the same talk at PyCon 2017 in Cardiff. Nothing more to add now, if the situation changes I will update you here and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/legopicode).
